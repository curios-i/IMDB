# Introduction
Sentiment Analysis is a common natural languag processing task that Data Scientist need to perform. In this project, a sentiment classifier is built which evaluates the polarity of piece of text being positive or negative. We have selected IMDB dataset: a set of 50,000 reviews from Internet Movie Database. We shall be using different deep machine learning (Deep Neural Network) methods to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The main objective of this project is to learn different deep learning techniques, though they were not taught in the HarvardX Data Science course.
